## Installation

You can install the development version of analysistools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("impact-initiatives/analysistools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to calculate the mean:

```{r example}
library(analysistools)
somedata <- data.frame(aa = 1:10,
                      bb = rep(c("a","b"),5),
                      weights = rep(c(.5,1.5),5))
dap_mean <- data.frame(group = c(NA, "bb"),
                      question_name = c("aa", "aa"),
                      level = c(.95, .95))
me_design <- srvyr::as_survey(somedata)
calculate_mean(me_design, dap_mean[1,])
calculate_mean(me_design, dap_mean[2,])
```
